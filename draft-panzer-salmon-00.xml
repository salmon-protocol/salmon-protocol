      <t>This document defines a lightweight, robust, and secure protocol for
        sending unsolicited notifications &#8212; especially comments and
        responses on syndicated feed content &#8212; to specified endpoints;
        along with rules to enable resulting content to itself be syndicated
        robustly and securely.</t>
      <t>This protocol defines the 'rules of the road' for these mechanisms,
        tying together and relying on lower level protocols and specifications
        for implementation.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Conversations are becoming distributed and fragmented on the Web.
        Content is increasingly syndicated and re-aggregated beyond its
        original context. Technologies such as Atom, RSS, and PubSubHubbub allow
        for a real time flow of updates to feed aggregators, but this leads
        to silo-ing of conversations. Replies, comments, ratings, and
        annotations increasingly happen at the aggregator and are invisible to
        the original source, and to anyone dependent on the original source.

        In addition, other types of non-content-based interaction  &#8212; such
        as following, friending, and mentioning  &#8212; are typically limited
        to social network silos.  The Salmon protocol provides a way to let
        this data migrate between distributed silos in a secure and
        interoperable way.

        The Salmon Protocol is an open, simple, standards-based solution that
        lets services unify the conversations.</t>

          It may be placed in an atom:entry, an atom:feed, or an HTML page.
          When placed at a feed level, all entries within the feed which do not
          have salmon-replies links of their own inherit their feed's
          salmon-replies link (which MUST be obtained from the entry's

    <section anchor="RPF" title="Replies Protocol Flow">
      <t>This section details the protocol flow for replies using Atom feeds.
        In Salmon, a reply
        is any type of activity that is primarily a response to a parent
        entry or activity.  Whether something is primarily a
        response is a contextual
        decision dependent on the application(s) in use.  Examples of replies
        include comments and likes/dislikes on syndicated feed items.</t>
      <t>A reply flow begins with a parent entry which the
        Salmon generator has retrieved or received from a foreign source,
        e.g., a syndication feed.  When the user replies to the entry,
        the Salmon generator creates a signed Atom entry per <xref
          target="Signing"/> to represent
        the comment.  The comment entry points at the parent entry using the
        Atom Threading Extension <xref target="RFC4685"/>.
        The generator creates a signed, enveloped salmon from the comment using
        the Magic Signatures specification
        <xref target="MagicSig"/>.  The generator then POSTs the resulting
        envelope
        to the salmon-replies endpoint for the parent entry.</t>

    <t>Note that salmon generators who also publish the salmon themselves SHOULD

      per <xref target="RFC4287"/>.</t>
    <t>[TODO: Describe how this works with two legged OAuth as well; OAuth is
     optional in
     general though Salmon endpoints can require it or rate-limit or treat different
     levels of auth'd generators differently.  In general OAuth provides for the
     ability to identify the generator and if missing, or if using something
     like the Google anonymous OAuth consumer, can be considered to be
     sent from an unverified salmon generator.]</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="RES" title="Reply Endpoint Semantics">
      <t>The Salmon endpoint responds to the salmon with standard HTTP codes,
        which are
        detailed in the subsequent sections.

        The semantics of a successful POST is dependent on the Salmon endpoint
        server.
        The Salmon client's responsibility ends once it receives a 2xx response.
        A possible, and expected, result is for the salmon to be re-published
        and re-syndicated along with other native comments on the syndicated
        feed item.  Therefore, salmon generators SHOULD use appropriate
        messaging to the user under the assumption that the data MAY be
        published with the same level of visibility as the rest of the comments.
        Endpoints are nevertheless not obligated to re-publish
        salmon; they may for example moderate them, spam block them,
        aggregate them, or analyze them.</t>
      <t>If the salmon endpoint does re-publish the salmon
        in the parent's comment feed, it MUST conform to additional requirements
        in <xref target="SRRR"/> in order to
        support the end-to-end Salmon protocol.  A salmon generator MAY
        use the mechanisms described in <xref target="SRRR"/> in
        order to subscribe to the consolidated feed of all replies, if
        available.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Signing" title="Salmon Signing Requirements" >
      <t>Salmon generators sign salmon using the mechanism described in
        <xref target="MagicSig"/>.  In the most common case, the Salmon
        generator is also the identity provider for the author URI.  The Salmon
        generator MAY maintain keypairs on behalf of its users or use additional
        mechanisms to allow users to maintain their own private keys (while
        still publishing the public keys).</t>
      <t>In a second scenario, the Salmon generator is itself a relying party
        (RP) for an external Identity Provider (IdP).  In the most general case,
        there are four parties with no pre-existing trust relationship:
        IdP, RP(generator), salmon receiver, and downstream syndicator.  From
        the viewpoint of the other parties, the IdP always signs the salmon.
        When the salmon generator is not also the IdP, it must delegate the
        signing task to the IdP.  To facilitate this, IdPs MAY provide the
        following standard API, protected via OAuth, to create signed Salmon on
        behalf of the user.</t>
      <section title="The 'salmon-signer' Link Relation">
        <t>The http://salmon-protocol.org/ns/salmon-signer link relation
          specifies a Salmon endpoint to be used to turn an unsigned entry into
          a signed salmon.  It is discovered
          via XRD discovery on the IdP host; that is, look for the salmon-signer
          relation in /.well-known/host-meta and use the resulting endpoint.</t>
        <t>The endpoint accepts a POST of an unsigned entry along with OAuth
          request credentials.  On success, it returns a 200 response and a body
          of type application/magic-envelope containing the signed Salmon.  On
          failure it returns standard error codes, including 401 or 403 for
          authorization failures and 400 for bad input.  The IdP MUST verify
          that it understands the input to be signed and that the user has
          previously granted the salmon generator access to signing services for
          salmon.  Note that the resulting signed salmon may be modified, e.g.,
          unknown markup may be stripped out rather than being signed.</t>
        <t>The full flow for signing a request in this most general case is
          then:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Generator obtains OAuth token for signing service via standard
              mechanisms (outside the scope of this document)</t>
            <t>Generator discovers the salmon-signer endpoint</t>
            <t>Generator POSTs an unsigned Atom Entry to the salmon-signer
              endpoint, with OAuth credentials.</t>
            <t>IdP checks credentials and content and signs the Salmon with the
              user's private key.</t>
            <t>IdP returns the signed application/magic-envelope salmon to the
              generator with a 200 OK response.</t>
            <t>Generator immediately sends the salmon to the desired final
              destination as in <xref target="RPF"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="SVR" title="Salmon Verification Requirements" >
      <t>This section describes the steps used to verify a salmon once
        received.  In each step, there is a specified error code to be used if
        the server wishes to inform the client about the error; the server is
        NOT REQUIRED to inform clients of errors and MAY simply return 202
        Accepted to complete the request at any time.  The verification
        checks are:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>REQUIRED: Verify the OAuth token, if any, used for the
            POST request.  Error code (if provided): 401 Unauthorized.
            Note: The server MAY provisionally accept the salmon at this
            point and return a 202 Accepted response.  This allows the
            server to perform the subsequent steps asynchronously.</t>
          <t>REQUIRED: Verify the magic signature using <xref
              target="MagicSig"/>.  If this verification fails, the
            salmon SHOULD NOT be publicly
            re-published.  Error code (if provided): 400 Bad Request.  The server
            MAY provide a human readable string in the response body.
            This step may be outsourced to a trusted third party verification
            service.Note that if the salmon generator is also the salmon
            author's identity provider, it can be considered to have fulfilled
            this step.  Therefore if the receiver trusts the salmon generator
            and can verify that is the author's identity provider, it
            can effectively skip this check.</t>
          <t>REQUIRED: Check the atom:updated timestamp on the Atom entry
            against the current server time and the validity period of the
            signing key.
            The timestamp SHOULD be no more than one hour behind the current
            time, and the signing key's validity period MUST cover the
            atom:updated timestamp.  Error code (if provided): 400 Bad Request.  The
            server MAY provide a human readable string in the response body.</t>
          <t>OPTIONAL: Perform rate limiting based on
            verified information such as the identity of the salmon generator
            or the identity of the author.  Error code (if provided):
            402 Payment Required (just kidding, actually 400).</t>
          <t>OPTIONAL: Perform abuse and spam control based on
            message content and other signals. Error code (if provided): 400 Bad
            Request.</t>
          <t>REQUIRED: Perform de-duplication of salmon to
            allow for updates and prevent content loops; see
            <xref target="SIDD"/>.
            If the server cannot determine a guid using these
            mechanisms it fails this step. Error code (if provided):
            400 Bad Request.</t>

    <section anchor="SIDD" title="Salmon Identification and De-Duplication">
      <t>Salmon uses the Atom entry id mechanism to help filter out duplicates.
        Since salmon can be syndicated in arbitrary ways, including loops, it is
        very important that co-operating systems can reliably signal whether a
        given salmon is an exact or approximate duplicate of another.  Salmon
        relies on the built in Atom id mechanism as the primary mechanism,
        with the Atom crosspost extension <xref target="Crosspost"/>
        as an override when the primary
        mechanism is not available. The rest of this section refers to the
        globally universally unique ID determined by this process as the entry's
        guid.  [TODO: Example needed here.]</t>
      <t>Security note:  When dealing with any entry which includes
        me:provenance, processors MUST determine the guid from the
        information within the signed provenance data rather than the unsigned
        top-level entry.</t>
      <t>The steps for determining the guid for an entry are:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>If the entry contains me:provenance, verify its signature per <xref
              target="MagicSig"/> and decode and parse the enveloped entry.  Use
            the resulting entry for subsequent steps in this algorithm.</t>
          <t>If the entry contains a crosspost:source with an atom:id child, use
            that atom:id's value as the guid.</t>
          <t>Otherwise, use the entry's own atom:id as the guid.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The salmon guid is also used to determine the proper action to take on
        receipt of a salmon.  There are three cases:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>For a previously unknown guid, the receiver creates a new salmon
            entry.</t>
          <t>For a guid which matches a previously created salmon, but with a
            newer timestamp, the receiver checks the ACL for the salmon and
            updates (replaces) the previous
            version with the new version.  The minimum ACL check consists of
            checking that the new author matches the old author.  Receivers
            MAY retain
            multiple revisions of salmon, but SHOULD use the most recent one
            (in atom:updated timestamp order) as the default version.</t>

            salmon consists of an at:deleted-entry

            the receiver SHOULD delete the local copy.  After a successful
            deletion the salmon MUST be removed from all reply feeds under
            the control of the receiver.</t>
          <t>Finally, if the guid and atom:updated timestamps both match a
            previously received salmon, the receiver SHOULD ignore the request
            as a duplicate.</t>
        </list>
        An update in which the new and old authors do not match SHOULD be
        rejected with
        a 403 Unauthorized error.  If the recipient has additional information
        (e.g., it knows that the new and old author ids are aliases) it MAY
        allow such updates as special cases.
      </t>
      <t>If a server completes the verification steps and wishes to inform the
        client about the success, it SHOULD respond with either a 202 Created
        (if the salmon is new), or 200 OK (if the salmon is an update or
        delete).  The server MAY provide a Location: header to inform the
        client of the published location of the resulting Atom entry on
        the server.

    <section anchor="SRRR" title="Salmon Reply Republishing Requirements" >
      <t>The goal of these requirements is to allow Salmon endpoints,
        generators, and
        syndicators to co-operate to present a unified view of the distributed
        conversation around a topic represented by a feed entry.</t>
      <t>A common use case is for a salmon to be syndicated in a consolidated
        reply feed with all other replies to a parent entry.  Specifically, the
        common feed mechanism is to publish a link with rel="replies" on the
        parent entry, which points at an Atom feed of replies
        (<xref target="RFC4685"/>).
        A service which
        wishes to re-syndicate salmon in this way SHOULD syndicate the salmon
        in the rel="replies" feed.  Note that services MAY re-syndicate salmon
        in other feeds.</t>
      <t>Services MUST NOT re-syndicate reply salmon which fail the verification
        process (<xref target="SVR"/>).</t>
      <t>Services MUST maintain the me:provenance element <xref
          target="MagicSig" />
        originally sent by the salmon generator in the re-syndicated entry.
        This is used to re-verify the salmon as needed by downstream third
        parties, to ensure correct de-duplication, and in particular is
        important to allow verification of
        authorship without depending on an intermediary.</t>
      <t>Services SHOULD either maintain the atom:id specified by the
        salmon generator, or use the
        crosspost:source/id of <xref target="Crosspost"/>
        to maintain the original id.  Note that the me:provenance element will
        convey this information in any case, and it overrides unsigned
        information for Salmon-aware processors.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="UX" title="User Experience and Privacy">
      <t>Users SHOULD be made aware of and give effective consent to the
        publishing scope of their salmon content prior to and after publication.
        The details of this user
        experience is both outside the scope of this document and will vary by
        content type and application.  As with security, Salmon generators and
        receivers SHOULD
        follow best current practices when implementing the user experience.</t>
    </section>

    <section  anchor="AS" title="Activity Streams">
      <t>Salmon is fully compatible with Activity Streams <xref target="AAE"/>
        Salmon MAY be activities, by having at least one activity:verb child
        element and one or more activity:object child elements.
        Salmon endpoints SHOULD accept appropriate activity verbs.  Salmon
        endpoints MAY reject inappropriate activities.
        [TODO: Should have some way to discover appropriate
        activities prior to posting!].  Note that a Salmon endpoint which is not
        aware of activity streams may simply accept and store (via the
        provenance element) the activity in question, but will treat it as a
        basic Atom entry.</t>
      <t>If an activity verb is included in a salmon reply, the 'Post' Verb is
        the most appropriate generic verb to use.  Other verbs such as 'Like'
        [TODO: Not in current AS spec, but in use] are possible and salmon
        generators are encourage to use the most specific verb they can identify
        for their use case.</t>
      <t>Nearly any activity verb could be included in a salmon mention
        <xref target="SMLR"/>.  The 'Post', 'Share', 'Save', and
        'Start Following'
        verbs <xref target="AABS"/> are particularly pertinent and salmon
        generators are encouraged to use the most specific verb they can
        identify.</t>
      <t>[TODO: Activity Streams currently conflicts with the atom:author
        specification and Salmon's use of the author:uri for signing and
        provenance; we need to resolve this conflict in the AS spec.]</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>A primary concern with this type of distributed protocol is how to
        prevent spam and abuse.  The protocol provides building blocks to allow
        services to implement in-depth defense against attacks, but is not
        itself a defense.  Specifically, every salmon has verifiable author,
        associated author identity provider identifier, and generator identifier
        URIs.  It also incorporates timestamps in the signed data.  Since
        POSTing a salmon to a Salmon endpoint is idempotent from a
        security point of
        view, replay attacks can be categorized as [what's the correct term for
        a DOS attack via legitimate but overwhelming traffic?].</t>
      <t>Note that Salmon ties the salmon guid to the author identifier for
        purposes of updating, replacing, or de-duping content.  Thus, poisoning
        a salmon repository with forged guids requires also forging Magic
        Signatures, or gaining control of the original author's signing keys.
      </t>
      <t>It is possible to outsource salmon verification or to delay
        verification until after salmon have already been processed (or
        published).  Salmon receivers should carefully consider the security
        implications of doing so for the content they are processing.</t>
      <t>Salmon depends on the Magic Signatures <xref target="MagicSig"/>
        specification for its basic
        verification steps.  Beyond that, it is RECOMMENDED that salmon
        recipients utilize best current anti-abuse practices,
        including implementing rate limiting of authors, identity
        providers, and generators, and in-depth spam and abuse control of the
        verified content.</t>
